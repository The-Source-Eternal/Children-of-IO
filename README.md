Children-of-IO
==============

An action/adventure/puzzle game to demystify programming and game-making.

Children of IO drops you in a land that is falling to pieces. You must make your way to the core, building an arsenal of tools to help you overcome the obstacles this broken place places in your path. Fix what's terribly wrong with this place or remain trapped in an eternal loop of disintegration.

Purely in design phase at the moment.
